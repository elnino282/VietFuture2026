# Replaces each service's Dockerfile with a Maven-Central-only version that
# no longer depends on maven.aliyun.com.
#
# Speed-ups baked in:
#   1. BuildKit `--mount=type=cache,target=/root/.m2/repository` so Maven's
#      local repo is persisted across `docker compose build` invocations and
#      shared between services that have overlapping deps. Without this,
#      every service re-downloads ~300 MB even though they share most deps.
#   2. A SECOND `RUN` pre-warms the cache via `dependency:resolve` so we
#      don't pay for source/javadoc jars that `package` doesn't need.
#   3. `-T 1C` parallel module execution; harmless for single-module services
#      but lets the multi-module ones fly.
#   4. `-Dmaven.artifact.threads=12` widens Maven Wagon's parallel HTTP
#      fetches when the link is slow.
#
# Run from the repo root:
#     pwsh scripts/rewrite_dockerfiles.ps1
#
# To seed the BuildKit cache with the developer's local ~/.m2 (Windows:
# %USERPROFILE%\.m2\repository), run BEFORE `docker compose build`:
#
#     docker buildx create --use --name=vietfuture-builder
#     docker buildx build --builder=vietfuture-builder --load ^
#         --cache-from=type=local,src=./.buildx-cache ^
#         --cache-to=type=local,dest=./.buildx-cache ^
#         -f finance-service/Dockerfile finance-service
#
# The first invocation seeds .buildx-cache/, subsequent `docker compose
# build` calls reuse it.
